Note to Instructor: Deviations from Project Proposal

There were some minor things we didn't include, such as a user signing up with his city. We thought this was irrelevant. Cooking specialty was changed to Interests. 

The search works in development and testing, but for some reason is case sensitive on Heroku. (so searching for Apple would work, but not apple).

We didn't include a complicated search query form since our recipes model doesn't have that many attributes to search by. If we had more time on this project, we would have implemented a way to search by tags, like #dinner, #lowcal, #asian, etc.
